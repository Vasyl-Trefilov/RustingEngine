//! Physics describes how objects will interact with the physics world and other physic objects. 
//!
//! Physics structure is always same for every object, but different shaders use physic in different ways.
//! To know more about 'how every shader use some physic param' you can look at compute shaders for more detailed describe. 
//! [`ComputeShaderType`]

//! # Complete physics example

//! ```
//! use rusting_engine::{Physics, CollisionType, ComputeShaderType};
//! 
//! // Bouncy basketball
//! let ball = Physics::default()
//!     .compute_shader(ComputeShaderType::FullPhysics)
//!     .collision_type(CollisionType::Sphere)
//!     .mass(0.6)      // 600g basketball
//!     .bounciness(0.8) // Very bouncy
//!     .friction(0.4)   // Some grip

//! // Heavy sliding block (ice-like)
//! let slider = Physics::default()
//!     .mass(50.0)      // 50kg

/// Core physic definition that describe all possible cases in physic world.

/// Physic can be very lightweight and very heavy in same time, its based on
/// which physic shader you use [`ComputeShaderType`]
/// and what is your physic tickrate for example Minecraft has 20 tickrate
/// this engine is using 60 tickrate.
/// 
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use rusting_engine::{ CollisionType, ComputeShaderType, Physics };
/// 
/// // Create floating cube that use maximal realistic shader
/// let floating_physic = &Physics::default()
///     .compute_shader(ComputeShaderType::FullPhysics) // FullPhysics has all possible physics cases as rotation, gravity, collisions, impulse and etc.
///     .mass(1.0) // equal to 1kg. More mass = more impulse when pushing other objects and etc.
///     .collision_type(CollisionType::Box) // Box collision
///     .gravity_scale(0.0); // Floating cube that is not pushed by gravity
/// 
/// // Create empty physic, no collision, no gravity, nothing, can be used to turn off physic or for debug
/// let empty_physic = &Physics::default()
