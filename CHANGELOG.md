- Grid collision shader

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-3

### Added

- Optimizing physic shaders and fragment shaders render. Collision check was **O(n²)**, now it splitted on grid, so its **O(n*k) + O(n*j)** where k is objects count in cell and j is big objects count.
- adding more physic settings like **_friction_**, **_gravity direction_** and **_bounciness_**.

### Fixed

- Object collapse on stacking.
