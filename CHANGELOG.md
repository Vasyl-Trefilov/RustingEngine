# Changelog

## [0.1.42] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- A lot of docs for better user experience( description of functions/values on hover )

### Fixed

- Culling is now working much better, without bugs.
- Fixing multi gltf model import, now each texture and model render good even if there are 10k gltf models. But each texture is separate, so you cant reuse texture without vram loss, I will fix it so fast as possible.

## [0.1.41] - 2026-04-6

### Added

- Added gltf models import, already with Materials, Textures and everything that needed

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-5

### Added

- Better code, now no warnings( before was like 60 )
- Added new very heavy fragment shader with noise and other things
- Culling toggle on 'C'

### Fixed

- Culling is working well and give insane performance boost on big scenes where fragment/vertex shader is heavy. But it uses object center, so some object might disappear earlier as needed. I will fix it in next patch

## [0.1.32] - 2026-04-5

### Added

- Added culling( when mesh is not in view => dont render ), but its beta, so its working bad

## [0.1.31] - 2026-04-4

### Added

- Just made code cleaner and only fixed some problems in shaders

### Fixed

- Grid collision shader

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-3

### Added

- Optimizing physic shaders and fragment shaders render. Collision check was **O(n²)**, now it splitted on grid, so its **O(n*k) + O(n*j)** where k is objects count in cell and j is big objects count.
- adding more physic settings like **_friction_**, **_gravity direction_** and **_bounciness_**.

### Fixed

- Object collapse on stacking.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-1

### Added

- Collision types as enum (Sphere, Box).
- Optional apply one physic/visual shader for all object on scene

### Fixed

- Better performance( main loop refactoring )

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Initial release!
- Different fragment shader support.
- Different physic shader support.
- Physics engine with per-object collision types (Box/Sphere).
- Same speed as pure Vulkano+winit
